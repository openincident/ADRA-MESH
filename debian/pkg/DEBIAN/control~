 OLSRD: optimized link-state routing daemon (unik-olsrd)
 unik-olsrd is an implementation of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol 
 for Mobile Ad-Hoc networks(MANET). The protocol is described in RFC3626. It 
 is designed to be run as a standalone server process. This version is
 customized for the Arizona Digital Radio Association.
 .
 OLSR operates as a table driven, proactive protocol, i.e., it exchanges 
 topology information with other nodes of the network regularly. It is 
 developed to work independently from other protocols. Likewise, OLSR makes no
 assumptions about the underlying link-layer.
