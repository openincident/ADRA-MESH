# This is ADRA olsrd.conf version 20110601
#
# OLSR.org routing daemon config file
# This file contains the usual options for an ETX based
# stationary network with fisheye
# (for other options see olsrd.conf.default.full)
#
# Lines starting with a # are discarded
#

#### ATTENTION for IPv6 users ####
# Because of limitations in the parser IPv6 addresses must NOT
# begin with a ":", so please add a "0" as a prefix.

###########################
### Basic configuration ###
###########################
# keep this settings at the beginning of your first configuration file

# Debug level (0-9)
# If set to 0 the daemon runs in the background, unless "NoFork" is set to true
# (Default is 1)

# DebugLevel  1

# IP version to use (4 or 6)
# (Default is 4)

# IpVersion 4

#################################
### OLSRd agent configuration ###
#################################
# this parameters control the settings of the routing agent which are not
# related to the OLSR protocol and it's extensions

# FIBMetric controls the metric value of the host-routes OLSRd sets.
# - "flat" means that the metric value is always 2. This is the preferred value
#   because it helps the linux kernel routing to clean up older routes
# - "correct" use the hopcount as the metric value.
# - "approx" use the hopcount as the metric value too, but does only update the
#   hopcount if the nexthop changes too
# (Default is "flat")

# FIBMetric "flat"

### Linux specific OLSRd extensions ###
#######################################
# these parameters are only working on linux at the moment, but might become
# useful on BSD in the future

# SrcIpRoutes tells OLSRd to set the Src flag of host routes to the originator-ip
# of the node. In addition to this an additional localhost device is created
# to make sure the returning traffic can be received.
# (Default is "no")

# SrcIpRoutes no

# Specify the proto tag to be used for routes olsr inserts into kernel
# currently only implemented for linux
# valid values under linux are 1 .. 254
# 1 gets remapped by olsrd to 0 UNSPECIFIED (1 is reserved for ICMP redirects)
# 2 KERNEL routes (not very wise to use)
# 3 BOOT (should in fact not be used by routing daemons)
# 4 STATIC 
# 8 .. 15 various routing daemons (gated, zebra, bird, & co)
# (defaults to 0 which gets replaced by an OS-specific default value
# under linux 3 (BOOT) (for backward compatibility)

# RtProto 0

# Activates (in IPv6 mode) the automatic use of NIIT
# (see README-Olsr-Extensions)
# (default is "yes")

# UseNiit yes

# Activates the smartgateway ipip tunnel feature.
# See README-Olsr-Extensions for a description of smartgateways.
# (default is "no")

# SmartGateway no

# Allows the selection of a smartgateway with NAT (only for IPv4)
# (default is "yes")

 SmartGatewayAllowNAT no

# Defines what kind of Uplink this node will publish as a
# smartgateway. The existence of the uplink is detected by
# a route to 0.0.0.0/0, ::ffff:0:0/96 and/or 2000::/3.
# possible values are "none", "ipv4", "ipv6", "both"
# (default is "both")

# SmartGatewayUplink "both"

# Specifies if the local ipv4 uplink use NAT
# (default is "yes")

# SmartGatewayUplinkNAT yes

# Specifies the speed of the uplink in kilobit/s.
# First parameter is upstream, second parameter is downstream
# (default is 128/1024)

# SmartGatewaySpeed 128 1024

# Specifies the EXTERNAL ipv6 prefix of the uplink. A prefix
# length of more than 64 is not allowed.
# (default is 0::/0

# SmartGatewayPrefix 0::/0

### OLSR protocol settings ###

# HNA (Host network association) allows the OLSR to announce
# additional IPs or IP subnets to the net that are reachable
# through this node.
# Syntax for HNA4 is "network-address    network-mask"
# Syntax for HNA6 is "network-address    prefix-length"
# (default is no HNA)

# Link quality algorithm (only for lq level 2)
# (see README-Olsr-Extensions)
# - "etx_float", a floating point  ETX with exponential aging
# - "etx_fpm", same as ext_float, but with integer arithmetic
# - "etx_ff" (ETX freifunk), an etx variant which use all OLSR
#   traffic (instead of only hellos) for ETX calculation
# - "etx_ffeth", an incompatible variant of etx_ff that allows
#   ethernet links with ETX 0.1.
# (defaults to "etx_ff")

#        (*nix systems only) Sends a HUP signal to the process specified
#        by the pidfile (usually /var/run/dnsmasq.pid) when the host name
